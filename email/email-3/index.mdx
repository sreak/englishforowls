### Subject: What I intend to do after my examination.

Dear X,

I hope you are well by the grace of almighty. I have gone through your email. You have expressed 
your desire to let you know what I will do after the HSC/SSC/JSC examination. You know, I belong 
to such village where most the people are unlettered/illiterate.
So, after my SSC exam I will go to my native village and open a night school for them. 
I will teach them there about essentials parts of life.
Please let me know about your plan to do after your exam.

Your loving friend,

Y.
