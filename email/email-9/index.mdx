Subject: Informing about prize giving ceremony.

Dear X,

Thanks for your email. I am glad to know that you are interested to know about the prize giving
ceremony of our college. Last week, the prize giving ceremony of our college was held.
It was took place in the auditoriam premises. The cheaf was the honourable educational minister.
The ceremony began at 4 pm after his arival. Our principal read the annual report.
The winners received prizes from the chief guests by turns. I personally, got two prizes.
The ceremony came to end with a cultural function. Really it was a cheerful function.

Love to all and other members of your family.

Yours ever,

Y
