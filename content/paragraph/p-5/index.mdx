## Paragraph: Deforestation.


The importance of forest in our life needs no mention. Unfortunately people are cutting
down trees in large number which is causing the natural environment inhabitable for
human beings. This indiscriminate cutting of trees is called deforestation. Deforestation
is mainly done by human beings. People cut trees to meet up their basic needs of food,
housing and making fire. For acquiring land for cultivation and residential purpose 
people are destroying forest in a gross manner. Sometimes deforestation is done in the 
name of development. But it is true that no sustainable development is possible causing
harm to the environment. Deforestation is a global problem which is haunting the whole
world. The result of deforestation is very serious. It can damage the environmental
situation severely leading us to an uninhabitable world. Bangladesh has only 16% of 
forest whereas there should be forest on the 25% land of the total land area. If 
this state continues one day the country may turn into a desert. Again deforestation 
gives rise to global temperature which turn may cause the lower parts of the 
world including Bangladesh go under water. So, to get out of this danger we should impose 
new rules as soon as posslio. Aand overall, the government should take necessary 
steps controlling deforestation from the country.
