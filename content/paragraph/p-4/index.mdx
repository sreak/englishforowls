## Paragraph: Global Warming.


Global warming means the increase in the average temperature of the earth's near-surface
air. The excessive release of carbon di-oxide is mainly responsible for this globai danger.
Millions of buses, trucks and other motor vehicles plying on the roads emit a huge amount 
of carbon di-oxide. Again, mills and factories bleach out black smoke and other toxic 
gases which contribute to increase the temperature in the atmosphere. Fires made by men to
cook food and for other domestic purpose add to global warming. In this way the 
temperature around the world increases permanently. This increase in temperature causes 
the ice-caps to melt. Huge ice getting melted cause the rise in the sea level. The salty
sea water will reduce the fertility of agricultural lands and create scarcity of food.
It also increases the intensity of extreme weather events such as flood, storm, cyclone 
etc. Bad news for Bangladesh is that the lower parts of Bangladesh will one day go 
under water. The coastal areas will be affected by frequent storm, cyclone and flood. 
Global warming has become a global issue for its violent and dominating effect. All 
the countries of the world including Bangladesh showed their concern
about the matter.
