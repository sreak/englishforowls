## Paragraph: Computer:

The word 'computer' derived from the Latin word 'compute' which means to count or
calculate. Hence the word 'computer' refers to a calculating machine. But it is a fairly 
recent invention. Charles Babbage was the first inventor of modern computer. Then
Professor Howard Akin gave it a revised and modern shape. Computer plays a very important
role in our practical and professional life. It is capable of doing every complicated work 
in all branches of learning. It can perform calculation in seconds which trained
mathematicians would need years to complete. The new generation computers can handle
millions of multiple problems and at the same time can be used as a media of
entertainment. Computer has contribution in the field of scientific projects, construction
projects, education, arts and what not. Computer doesn't have any demerit in the truest
sense of the term. But it is we, human being, who use this device for evil
purpose. We should be aware of its wrong use. It has now become a part and parcel of
modern life. It has greatly benefited us and brought about revolutionary changes in our
life. In a word, this modern fascinating device has become an inseparable part of our
life.
