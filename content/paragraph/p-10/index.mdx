## Paragraph: Corruption:

Corruption means dishonest or illegal behaviour to the country. It creates a lot of problem for the country men. None can escape from the harm of corruption. It is a social
malady. It spreads its greedy clutches all over the coUntry.
Today every government sector of the country is rotten to the core because of the
widespread practice of corruption by the people who are at the helm of power by the
officers, by the clerks and so on. They take bribe from the common people for giving the
illegal service. The country has already topped the list of corrupt countries five times.
There is none to raise voice against the galloping corruption. However, there are many
reasons behind this corruption and the reasons are not far to seek. The greed for
power, pelf, wealth and money is the root cause of corruption. Avarice,
dishonesty, nepotism and favouritism are also responsible for corruption. The consequence
of corruption has a far reaching effect on socio-economic condition of our country. It
hinders the development programmes. The widespread practice of corruption should not be
allowed to go unchecked. The corrupt people must be brought down with an iron
rod. It should be checked, controlled and prevented at any cost so that the country canals get rid of this national malady. It is heartening to note that the Independent
Anti-Corruption Commission, set up recently, has been working seriously to check
corruption. overall, we general perople should be conscious about it.
