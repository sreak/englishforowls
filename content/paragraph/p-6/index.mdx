## Paragraph: Dowry System.

The dowry system is a heinous malpractice which the people of our country have been nourishing for long years. Dowry is the large amount of money or property that the 
bride or her family is bound to pay to the bridegroom as a condition of the marriage to 
happen. Poverty is the main cause of dowry. It is poverty which makes the bridegroom 
shameless to demand money from the bride party at the time of marriage. However, it is not the only reason of dowry system. Because it is prevalent in solvent families as well. In our socio-economic structure dowry is given and taken as a penalty to the bride party. 
Moreover the greed of the bridegroom for getting illegal money is the Vital Cause of dowry. 
Dowry system gives birth to various problems in the society. It has so many bad effects. 
The wives are often tortured and beaten to death for not bringing dowry. I think dowry 
system is very disgraceful for the society and for the humanity. For eliminating dowry system the government should enhance applying the rules strictly. Awareness should 
be risen to protest this malpractice socially. It is a matter of hope that besides the 
government, many a non-governrnent organizations are working to get rid of this social 
curse.
