## Paragraph: Price Hike.

The rising in price of the essential cornhodities is called price hike. Price
hike is not new in our economy. Nowadays we are very anxious go see the price of
necessary things going up everyday. It is increasing by leaps and bounds. The situation
seems to be beyond control The poorer and the middle class people are in a fix for this
sudden price hike. The reaction of the common people about it is also very
bitter. There is no denial that with this critical situation Bangladesh is now in the
grip of economic crisis. Though the government is trying to control and regulate the
market but with a little success. It is occurring in a irregular way day after day.
If the situation goes the same for long it will cause failure to our economic
system. Besides, the law and order situation may decrease. A number of traders
are trying to manipulate the market and creating artificial crisis of day-to-day necessary goods. They are causing a problem to the whole nation to satisfy
their greed. To get rid of this situation every conscious citizen and the government
should protest against syndicating and manipulating the market by some criminals. Strict
rules should be implied to find out and punish the culprits who are involved in
creating artificial crisis.
