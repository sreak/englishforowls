### Subject: About my aim in life.

Dear X,

Thanks for your email. You have asked me to let you know that about my aim in life. Surely,
I have an aim in life that I cherish. My aim in life is to be a doctor. There are many reasons to
for choosing this profession. The poor village people of our country suffer from various diseases.
But there is no qualified doctor to serve them. They have to depend on the quacks.
So, I have decided to be a doctor to serve them. After obtaining the MBBS degree I will go different
to seerve villagers. Even, I have a plan to set a cheritable dispensary in my native village.

No more today. kindly pray for me so that I can achieve my goal.

Your loving friend,

Y.
