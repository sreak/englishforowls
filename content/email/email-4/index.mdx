### Subject: Invitation for attending birthday party.

Dear X,

The coming 10th October is my birthday. You will be glad to know that a tea party has been 
arranged on that occasion at our residence  at 6 pm. Only my cousins and few friends will join
the party. A musical programme will also be arranged. Would you kindly give me the pleasure of 
your company on the occasion?

I am eagerly waiting to meet with you.

Your sincerely,

Y.
