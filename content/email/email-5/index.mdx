### Subject: Thanks for the nice birthday present.

Dear X,

I hope you are wll by the grace of almighty. I am very glad to receive the gift sent by you 
on my birthday. I expected your presence in the function. But, you did not attend the birhdat
because of your illness.

However, you have remembered my birthday and proved it by sending a nice mobile set to me. 
My words are inadequate to thank you for the lovely gift. Now I offer my heartiest love to you for this.

Convey my best regards to your parents and love to the younger ones.

Yours ever,

Y.
