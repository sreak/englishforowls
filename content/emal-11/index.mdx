Subject: Food and food habits of the people of Bangladesh(Your country name.)

Dear Tulip,

Hope you well. You asked me to inform you about foods and food habits of the people of our beloved country.(Bangladesh)

Actually, the people of Bangladesh are not so rich rich as you are. Most of them are farmers and live below the 

provert line. They grow vegetables, pulses, lentils, fish, rear goats etc. They are infact fond of 

rice, pulses, vegetables, fish, meat and drinking cow milk. They take meals three times a day. Few of them also 

eat ruti plus curry at night or morning.

Let me tell yours. I am eagerly waiting to hear about yours.

Your loving friend.
