Subject: Co-curricular activities of our school.

Dear Tulip,

In your last email you have wanted to know about the co-curricular activities of our school/college.

Besides, academic activities, we regularly play cricket, football, table tennis, volleyball etc.

We also work in our school garden speep/clean our classes by turns. Our teachers also encourage us to take

part of these activities. We additionally take part on debates, extempore speeces and many other cultural activities.


A school magazine also published annually from our school and we visit to study tour and we happily
take part on them.

No more today. With best wishes and love to all.

Yours ever,

Mayuri.(Y)
